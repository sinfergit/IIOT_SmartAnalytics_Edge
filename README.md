# IIOT_SmartAnalytics_Edge
This is a solution which demonstrates IIoT functionality within a smart building concept by interconnecting building management system with IoT edge modules in near realtime and performing advanced data analytics using machine learning models.

Inflex TICK Stack (Inflex DB, Telegraf, Kapacitor, ) has been used in order to build the data pipelines as it supports the realtime streaming, batching, performing analytics using Kapacitor and finally visualizing the results with Chronograf.
